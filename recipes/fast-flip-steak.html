    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When you are using the fast-flip method of cooking steak, you flip the steak every 30 seconds, which gives great results
    every time. And the steak cooks 30% faster, to boot!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 beef sirloin steak, at room temperature</li>
        
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        
        <li>3 tablespoons high-heat cooking oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a heavy cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pat steak dry with paper towels on both sides. Season
        generously with salt on both sides.</li>
        <li>Drizzle oil into the hot skillet. Add steak and cook for 30 seconds. Flip steak onto the other side and cook for 30
        seconds, then flip again. Continue flipping, cooking 30 seconds on each side.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the pan when it has developed a brown crust, is beginning to firm, and is hot and slightly pink in the
        center, about 3 to 4 minutes of total cooking time for a 1-inch steak. Check for doneness using an instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center and these numbers as a guideline: 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for rare; 130
        degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare; 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium; or 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for
        well done.</li>
        <li>Cover steak with 2 layers of aluminum foil and allow to rest in a warm area for 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
