    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the
        muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful extra-generously-sized deli style muffin. Add extra blueberries too, if
        you want!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with muffin liners.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, salt and baking powder. Place vegetable oil into a 1 cup measuring cup;
             add the egg and add enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark. Mix this with flour mixture. Fold in blueberries. 
             Fill muffin cups right to the top, and sprinkle with crumb topping mixture.</li>
        <li>To Make Crumb Topping: Mix together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Mix with fork, and sprinkle over muffins before baking.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until done.</li>
    </ol>
